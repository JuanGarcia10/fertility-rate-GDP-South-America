# INTRODUCTION

Fertility rate has been a big topic in the industrialized countries in the last decade. The social insurance systems are based on the idea that society will always grow. In other words: the number of children per woman is higher than 2. However, there is a clear trend in the developed countries like here in Germany for families to have fewer children. At the same time we have observed how the GDP per capita has been increasing dramatically over the years. I am interested in the relation between these two factors for emerging countries. in this case I will be analyzing the Spanish speaking countries in South America

# DATASET
I will be working with a dataset from the world bank with thousends of economic indicators for all countries over the last 50 years. The dataset can be, however, be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators). I will be using only the folder "world-development-indicators". **This will not be provided in the repository as it is too big for it.**
